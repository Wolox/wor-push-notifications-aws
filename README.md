# Wor::Push::Notifications::Aws
Provide basic setup for storing device tokens and sending Push Notifications to your application using AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wor-push-notifications-aws'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wor-push-notifications-aws

## Configuration
To use the gem, firstly we have to configure it. But don’t worry since the configuration simply consists of these three steps:
1. Firstly, add `require 'aws-sdk-rails'` to your application.rb in order to include the required aws modules. Once then, you’ll be able to configure your aws instance (see “AWS credentials” section).
2. Then, under the config/initializers dir, create the file `wor_push_notifications_aws.rb`, with:
```ruby
Wor::Push::Notifications::Aws.configure do |config|
  config.device_types = [:ios, :android] 		# optional
  config.table_name = 'users'          			# optional
  config.aws_region = 'us-east-1'
  config.aws_android_arn = 'android:arn'
  config.aws_ios_arn = 'ios:arn'
  config.aws_ios_badge = [true/false]
end
```
3. The last step involves running the install generator, which basically will create a migration file so that we add a column to your selected table which will store the tokens. To run the generator, run the following commands:
```ruby
$ rails generate wor:push:notifications:aws:install
$ rake db:migrate
```

## Usage
***Note***: If you haven’t configured sns, now it’s the moment. (See “SNS Setup”).

So far we have the gem and sns configured, so let’s move to what the gem can do.
As it’s purpose is to make the app send push notifications, there are 3 methods, **add_token**, **delete_token** and **send_message**, to add/delete the device_token, and to send the message.

***[here some comments about device token and device type.]***

### Add token
Attach device_tokens to a given user instance:
```ruby
PushNotifications.add_token(user, device_token, device_type)
```
#### Parameters
- user: Instance where we want to add the device_token so that we can send push notifications.
- device_token
- device_type: So far we support the values :android or :ios

### Delete token
Delete token from the user instance:
```ruby
PushNotifications.delete_token(user, device_token)
```
#### Parameters
- user: Instance where we want to add the device_token so that we can send push notifications.
- device_token

### Send message
Send a given message to the user instance:
```ruby
PushNotifications.send_message(user, message_content)
```
#### Parameters
- user: Instance which will receive the message. It must have added the device_token before.
- message_content: Message we want to send to the user.
                   This parameter must follow a specific format.
                   ***[Some comments about the format of the message_content ( { message: "bla bla"} )]***

## AWS Credentials
[Requirements (aws) -> credentials and arn needed.
Suggest to use ENV variables & secrets when setting up the configuration.
Point out that the credentials have to be set up as one of the ways that appear in the
"credentials" section at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SNS/Client.html.]

## Requirements
Since a json attribute is needed to store device_tokens on the user table,
Postgres 9.3 or higher is required.
